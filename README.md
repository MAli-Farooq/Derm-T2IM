# Derm-T2IM: Harnessing Synthetic Skin Lesion Data via Stable Diffusion Models
This repo contains all the codes. trained models, Newly generated synthetic skin lesion dataset using dreambooth and LoRA tools.

### The complete block diagram represetation along with working methodology of the proposed system is as follows.

### The below figure shows smart transformation results which includes tiny benign moles, multiple moles on skin region, and large malignant moles.
